Figure X. PCA plot of samples projected onto the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2). PC1 (x-axis) captures the primary pattern of variation, representing the largest share of variance in the dataset. It reflects a weighted combination of elements that tend to increase or decrease together, as shown by their loadings. Loadings are the coefficients that describe how much each original element contributes to a principal component; they indicate both the strength and direction of the relationship between each element and the component. Elements with large positive loadings on PC1 increase together in samples with high PC1 scores, while those with large negative loadings decrease, driving the major differences among samples. PC2 (y-axis) captures the second most important and independent pattern of variation, orthogonal to PC1. Its loadings reveal elements that vary in a way not explained by PC1, often highlighting contrasts or inverse relationships between different groups of elements. The direction and magnitude of these loadings represent the strength and nature of linear correlations between elements and each principal component. Samplesâ€™ positions along these components show how much they express these combined elemental patterns. Samples that group closely together on the plot have similar elemental profiles according to the patterns captured by PC1 and PC2, indicating they share common characteristics or sources. The percentage of variance explained by each component is shown on the axis labels.
