Heat-Activated Germinators
Taxon	Notes
Plicaria endocarpoides	Pezizales, germinates after heat/fire
Scutellinia (otu953)	Pezizales, known from fire-following surveys

‚ö° Rapid Colonizers
Taxon	Notes
Candida friedrichii	Opportunistic yeast
Cladosporium (uncultured)	Frequently appears early post-disturbance
Madurella fahalii	Thermotolerant, opportunistic
Periconia digitata	Found in charcoal-rich environments
Sporothrix schenckii	Dimorphic, thermotolerant soil yeast
Bolbitius titubans	Found on early plant debris post-fire
Pseudogymnoascus (uncultured)	Found in burned soils
Cunninghamella sp.	Mucoralean, fast-growing soil fungus
Gongronella butleri	Similar to Cunninghamella
Lichtheimia ornata	Rapid-growing soil fungus
Zygotorulaspora mrakii	Yeast, potentially an early colonizer
Lachancea thermotolerans	Tolerant of harsh environments
Hanseniaspora valbyensis	Yeast from disturbed habitats

üß± PyOM (Charcoal) Degraders
Taxon	Notes
Periconia digitata	One of the few fungi known to colonize charcoal
Knufia sp.	Rock/charcoal colonizer, melanized, slow-growing
Herpotrichia australis	Potential endophyte/saprotroph on blackened wood
Rhodoveronaea aquatica	Black yeast, tolerates PyOM-like substrates (limited evidence)

üåø Plant Debris Degraders
Taxon	Notes
Auriculariaceae (uncultured)	Jelly fungi on wood
Corticiaceae sp.	Corticioid wood rotters
Epithele typhae	Corticioid decomposer
Hypochnicium lyndoniae	Wood-decay basidiomycete
Phaeoacremonium minimum	Saprobe/weak pathogen on wood
Lambertella sp.	Cup fungi on dead leaves or twigs
Slooffia (uncultured)	Yeast-like saprobes
Pycnobasidium (uncultured)	Possibly wood saprobe
Tilletiopsis washingtonensis	Rare, but sometimes found on decaying plant material
Polychytrium aggregatum	Aquatic decomposer of cellulose
Borealophlyctis paxensis	Chytrid, possibly involved in debris decay

üå± Mycorrhizal Reestablishers
Taxon	Notes
Amanita phalloides	Ectomycorrhizal with oaks and pines
Floccularia luteovirens	Ectomycorrhizal, returns in late-succession forests
Ectomycorrhiza (uncultured)	General ectomycorrhizal fungi
Acaulospora (uncultured)	Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (Glomeromycota)
Glomeromycotina (uncultured)	Arbuscular mycorrhizae, slow re-colonizers

‚ùì Unassigned / Miscellaneous
Taxon	Reason
Acrocalymma sp.	Mostly plant pathogens
Ascomycota sp.	Too broad
Basidiomycota sp.	Too broad
Chytridiomycota sp.	Aquatic; unclear fire role
Cryptomycota (both)	Unknown ecological role
Eremothecium sinecaudum	Rare yeast
Herteliana schuyleriana	Lichen, obscure ecology
Lecanora hybocarpa	Lichen-forming; late colonizer, but unclear successional role
Rhodosporidiobolus jianfalingensis	Rare yeast
Soil (uncultured)	Not specific
Toniniopsis separabilis	Lichen-forming; unclear role
Vacuiphoma oculihominis	Opportunistic pathogen
